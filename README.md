Potato Leaf Disease Detection System
This repository contains a deep learning-based system for detecting potato leaf diseases using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a web application for real-time predictions. 
The system helps farmers and researchers quickly identify whether a potato leaf is healthy, affected by early blight, or late blight.

Features :-
1) Trained CNN model for classifying potato leaf images.
2) Web-based interface for uploading leaf images and viewing predictions.
3) Real-time disease detection with user-friendly results.
4) Built using Python, TensorFlow/Keras, and Flask/Django/FastAPI (depending on your code).
5) Deployable locally or on cloud services (Heroku, AWS, etc.).

Classifications :-
1) Healthy Leaf
2) Early Blight
3) Late Blight

Installation & Usage :-

1) Clone the repository -
git clone https://github.com/your-username/potato-leaf-disease-detection.git 
cd potato-leaf-disease-detection
2) Install dependencies -
pip install -r requirements.txt
